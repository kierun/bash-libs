# bash-libs

A collections of really useful[⸮](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_mark) bash scripts that you can source into your own script to make your script more niffty.

## What is in there?

### logging.bash

This is an over-engineered bash script template with 256 colour logging…

### sleeper.bash

To be documented…

### wallpaper_rotation.bash

You should have one top level directory, let's call this `~/wallpapers`.  Your
wallpapers need to be split into several sub directories.

A preferred directory (`~/wallpapers/preferred`) which contains the best of
the best images. Those are the ones that you will see most often in the
rotation.

The rest should be put in directories by date (`~/wallpapers/2016`,
``~/wallpapers/2015`) when you got the wallpaper. Assuming that you have a
more or less linear progression (say `2014` → `2015` → `2016` → `2017`) then
the more recent directory will get a higher priority.

## Notes.

**Criticism, bug reports, and improvements are most welcome! ☺**
