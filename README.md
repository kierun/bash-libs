[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com/?lines=Really+useful⸮+bash+scripts)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

- Some of which you can source into your own script to make your script more nifty.

**Criticism, bug reports, and improvements are most welcome! ☺**

Please install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) and run
`pre-commit install`.
