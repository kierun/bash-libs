# bash libs

A collections of really useful[⸮](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_mark) bash
scripts that you can source into your own script to make your script more nifty.

**Criticism, bug reports, and improvements are most welcome! ☺**

## What is in there?

### `logging.bash`

This is an over-engineered bash script template with 256 colour logging…

### sleeper.bash

To be documented…

### `wallpaper_rotation.bash`

You should have one top level directory, let's call this `~/wallpapers`. Your
wallpapers need to be split into several sub directories.

A preferred directory (`~/wallpapers/Preferred`) which contains the best of the
best images. Those are the ones that you will see most often in the rotation.

The rest should be put in directories with a capital letter. Something like
`Witcher` or whatever. They all have equal weight.

## `convert_mp4_gif.bash`

Converts `mp4` into `gif`.

## `convert_webp_png.bash'

Convert `webp` into `png`.

## `nifty-colours.bash'

Some nifty colours and a nice banner.

## `spinner.bash'

A spinner for long tasks so something is still being shown no screen.

## `switch-browser.bash'

Switch default browser from Chrome to Firefox and back.

## `switch-sound.bash'

Switch from speakers to headphones and back.

## `upgrade.sh'

Does upgrade operations on Ubuntu and Fedora. Includes flatpak and pipx for
added horror.
