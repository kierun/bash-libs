# bash libs

A collections of really useful[⸮](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_mark) bash
scripts that you can source into your own script to make your script more nifty.

## What is in there?

### `logging.bash`

This is an over-engineered bash script template with 256 colour logging…

### sleeper.bash

To be documented…

### `wallpaper_rotation.bash`

You should have one top level directory, let's call this `~/wallpapers`. Your
wallpapers need to be split into several sub directories.

A preferred directory (`~/wallpapers/Preferred`) which contains the best of the
best images. Those are the ones that you will see most often in the rotation.

The rest should be put in directories with a capital letter. Something like
`Witcher` or whatever. They all have equal weight.

## Notes

**Criticism, bug reports, and improvements are most welcome! ☺**
